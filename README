This code accompanies a manuscript that examines data 
from the GBR MMP inshore water quality program (MMP WQ) 
and assesses the impact that the sampling re-design had 
on the power to detect trends in six priority water 
quality analytes, which is a primary objective of the 
MMP WQ. 

Below we detail the contents of this repository.

/core_analytical
   Contains the three main scripts used to perform the 
   Bootstrap resampling power analysis.

   analysis_phase_3_log_linear_hpc_parts.R
     - An R script that can be used with the Rscript
       binary and takes trailing arguments for use with
       HPC systems. The script requires the 
       powerBoot functions that are sourced from 
       power_boot_functions.R. 

       The script performs the pre-2015 versis post-2015
       analysis, which works through 24 combinations
       of analyte and Natural Resource Management (NRM) 
       areas.

       Results generated from this code can be seen in
       plotting/results/results_hpc_loglm and are 
       divided by NRM and then by analyte. Results 
       include for each combination diagnostic figures
       model fits in .Rdata format and the power
       sets for the 1000 replicates.

  sites_vs_sampling_phase_3_hpc.R.R
    - An R script that can be used with the Rscript
      binary and takes trailing arguments for use with
      HPC systems. The script requires the 
      powerBoot functions that are sourced from 
      power_boot_functions.R. 

      The script performs the sites versus samples
      analysis, which works through 20 combinations
      of analyte and Natural Resource Management (NRM) 
      areas.

      Results generated from this code can be seen in
      plotting/results/sites_vs_samples and are 
      divided by NRM and then by analyte. Results 
      include for each combination diagnostic figures
      model fits in .Rdata format and the power
      sets for the 1000 replicates.
  
  power_boot_functions.R
    - Core functions of the Bootstrap power analysis. 
      There are three functions 
      1. powerBoot2 - written for the individual site scale  
      2. powerBoot2Regional - written for the regional 
                              analysis 
      3. powerBoot2Regional2 - written for the regional 
                              analysis but resample 
                              the residuals within site

      Each function takes inputs 
        - fit   - fitted linear model from lm
        - nSim  - number of Bootstrap resamples
        - delta - fractional year on year change
        - trend.nm - name of linear trend model component 
        - mod.res - logical for whether the modified residuals
                    should be used. Default is true.

      Outputs
       - A set of pvals evaluating the significance of the
         two sided test for the linear trends coefficient for 
         the  nSim Bootstrap replicates

/plotting
  - Code to generate plots from results for main text
    and some of the supplemental material. 

    crayon_plots_all.R
      - This Rscript generates power curves from the
        bootstrap analysis results/ for both the
        pre-v-post 2015 analyses and the sites v samples
        analysis. Generates supplemental figures 3 and 10

    power_pre_post_plots.R
       - Generates Figure 3 of the main text - pre v post
         - from the results/results_hpc_loglm results set

    power_sts_vs_samps.R
      - Generates Figure 4 of the main text -
        sites v samples - from the
        results/sites_vs_samples results set
